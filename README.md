Web app database, used by [WebCatalog](https://webcatalogapp.com) & [Singlebox](https://singleboxapp.com).

If you have an web application you'd like to see added, follow the instructions.

## How it Works

This package is a joint effort between humans and robots.

First, a human adds an app:

```
apps
â””â”€â”€ gmail
    â”œâ”€â”€ gmail-icon.png
    â””â”€â”€ gmail.yml
```

The yml file requires just a few fields:

```yml
name: Gmail
url: 'https://gmail.com'
category: Productivity
```

The human then opens a PR. Tests pass, the PR gets merged. Yay!

Later, a bot comes along and generate additional files. Lastly, the bot publishes a new release to our server.

## Submit New App
If you have an web application you'd like to see added, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/atomery/catalog/issues) or
[open a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

### Adding New App By Hand ðŸ’ª
An easy way to add a new app is to copy an existing app and edit its metadata.

To do so, create a new directory in the `apps` directory and include a `.yml`
file and two `.png` icon files (transparent one for WebCatalog and filled one for Singlebox). The directory can only contain numbers,
lowercase letters, and dashes, and the yml and icon files should be named
like so:

```
apps
â””â”€â”€ my-cool-app
    â”œâ”€â”€ my-cool-app-icon.png
    â”œâ”€â”€ my-cool-app-icon-filled.png
    â””â”€â”€ my-cool-app.yml
```
